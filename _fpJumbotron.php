        <p>The world’s greatest word game is back with an all-new look! Fill in the blanks and be the funniest person in the room!</p>
        <p>Originally a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the – often comical or nonsensical – story aloud. The game was frequently played as a party game
            or as a pastime.</p>

        <p>The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of Mad Libs books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958.</p>
